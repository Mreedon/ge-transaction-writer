# GE Transaction Writer

A minimal, passive RuneLite plugin that logs all Grand Exchange transactions to a local JSON file.

Each event (BUY, SELL, CANCEL, EMPTY_SLOT) is recorded with full detail and timestamp.
The output can be used for tracking flips, analyzing market activity, or feeding personal tools.

### Roadmap

This plugin is a minimal, standalone logging tool. Future updates may include:

- Config panel to toggle fields and file output modes
- Optional session ID tagging
- Sidebar tooltip showing current log file and event count
- Additional GE event types (e.g. ‚ÄúCollect All‚Äù detection)

All features will remain local-only and Plugin Hub‚Äìcompliant.
